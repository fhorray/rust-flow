# Boolean Logic

## Description

You can combine booleans using logic operators:

- `&&` (AND): true only if BOTH are true.

- `||` (OR): true if AT LEAST ONE is true.

- `!` (NOT): inverts the boolean.

Your task is to make the expression `is_rust_fun` evaluate to `true` by changing the values of `t` and `f`.
