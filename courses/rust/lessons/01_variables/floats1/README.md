# Floating Point Numbers

## Description

Rust has two floating-point types: `f32` (32-bit) and `f64` (64-bit).

`f64` is the default because on modern CPUs it's roughly the same speed as `f32` but has more precision.

Your task is to:

1. Declare a variable `x` with value `3.14` and type `f64`.

2. Declare a variable `y` with value `3.14` and type `f32`.

## Hints

1. `let x: f64 = ...;`
