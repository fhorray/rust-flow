# Tuples

## Description

Tuples are fixed-size groups of values of potentially different types.

They are useful for returning multiple values from a function or grouping related data.

Your task is to:

1. Create a tuple `t` containing `(500, 6.4, "Hello")`.

2. Access the second element (the float) and print it.

## Hints

1. Tuple syntax uses parentheses: `(v1, v2)`.

2. Access tuple elements using dot notation: `t.0`, `t.1`, etc.
