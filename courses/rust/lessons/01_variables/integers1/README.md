# Integers

## Description

Rust has signed (`i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`) and unsigned (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`) integers.

Each type has a specific range of values it can store.

Your task is to declare a variable `x` with the type `u8` and set it to 255.

Then declare a variable `y` with the type `i8` and set it to -128.

## Hints

1. `u8` goes from 0 to 255.

2. `i8` goes from -128 to 127.
