# Arrays

## Description

Arrays in Rust have a fixed length and contain elements of the same type.

They are allocated on the stack.

Your task is to:

1. Create an array named `a` containing the numbers 1 through 5.

2. Access the second element (index 1) and print it.

## Hints

1. Array syntax uses square brackets: `[v1, v2, v3]`.

2. Array indexing starts at 0.
