# 🦀 Rust Setup Guide

To run the exercises in this course, you need to have **Rust** and **Cargo** installed on your system.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### 1. Install Rustup (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Rust is using `rustup`.

- **Windows**: Download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://rustup.rs/).
- **macOS / Linux**: Run the following in your terminal:
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

### 2. Verify Installation

After installing, open a **new** terminal and run:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### 3. Check Again

Once you have verified the installation, click the **"Check Again"** button in Progy to continue.

> [!TIP]
> If you are on Windows, you might also need the **C++ build tools** for Visual Studio. The Rust installer will prompt you if they are missing.
