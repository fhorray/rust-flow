# Tool Calling

As covered under Foundations, [tools](/docs/foundations/tools) are objects that can be called by the model to perform a specific task.
AI SDK Core tools contain several core elements:

- **`description`**: An optional description of the tool that can influence when the tool is picked.
- **`inputSchema`**: A [Zod schema](/docs/foundations/tools#schemas) or a [JSON schema](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) that defines the input parameters. The schema is consumed by the LLM, and also used to validate the LLM tool calls.
- **`execute`**: An optional async function that is called with the inputs from the tool call. It produces a value of type `RESULT` (generic type). It is optional because you might want to forward tool calls to the client or to a queue instead of executing them in the same process.
- **`strict`**: _(optional, boolean)_ Enables strict tool calling when supported by the provider

<Note className="mb-2">
  You can use the [`tool`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/tool) helper function to
  infer the types of the `execute` parameters.
</Note>

The `tools` parameter of `generateText` and `streamText` is an object that has the tool names as keys and the tools as values:

```ts highlight="6-17"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

<Note>
  When a model uses a tool, it is called a "tool call" and the output of the
  tool is called a "tool result".
</Note>

Tool calling is not restricted to only text generation.
You can also use it to render user interfaces (Generative UI).

## Strict Mode

When enabled, language model providers that support strict tool calling will only generate tool calls that are valid according to your defined `inputSchema`.
This increases the reliability of tool calling.
However, not all schemas may be supported in strict mode, and what is supported depends on the specific provider.

By default, strict mode is disabled. You can enable it per-tool by setting `strict: true`:

```ts
tool({
  description: 'Get the weather in a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string(),
  }),
  strict: true, // Enable strict validation for this tool
  execute: async ({ location }) => ({
    // ...
  }),
});
```

<Note>
  Not all providers or models support strict mode. For those that do not, this
  option is ignored.
</Note>

## Input Examples

You can specify example inputs for your tools to help guide the model on how input data should be structured.
When supported by providers, input examples can help when JSON schema itself does not fully specify the intended
usage or when there are optional values.

```ts
tool({
  description: 'Get the weather in a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
  }),
  inputExamples: [
    { input: { location: 'San Francisco' } },
    { input: { location: 'London' } },
  ],
  execute: async ({ location }) => {
    // ...
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Only the Anthropic providers supports tool input examples natively. Other
  providers ignore the setting.
</Note>

## Tool Execution Approval

By default, tools with an `execute` function run automatically as the model calls them. You can require approval before execution by setting `needsApproval`:

```ts highlight="13"
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const runCommand = tool({
  description: 'Run a shell command',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    command: z.string().describe('The shell command to execute'),
  }),
  needsApproval: true,
  execute: async ({ command }) => {
    // your command execution logic here
  },
});
```

This is useful for tools that perform sensitive operations like executing commands, processing payments, modifying data, and more potentially dangerous actions.

### How It Works

When a tool requires approval, `generateText` and `streamText` don't pause execution. Instead, they complete and return `tool-approval-request` parts in the result content. This means the approval flow requires two calls to the model: the first returns the approval request, and the second (after receiving the approval response) either executes the tool or informs the model that approval was denied.

Here's the complete flow:

1. Call `generateText` with a tool that has `needsApproval: true`
2. Model generates a tool call
3. `generateText` returns with `tool-approval-request` parts in `result.content`
4. Your app requests an approval and collects the user's decision
5. Add a `tool-approval-response` to the messages array
6. Call `generateText` again with the updated messages
7. If approved, the tool runs and returns a result. If denied, the model sees the denial and responds accordingly.

### Handling Approval Requests

After calling `generateText` or `streamText`, check `result.content` for `tool-approval-request` parts:

```ts
import { type ModelMessage, generateText } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [
  { role: 'user', content: 'Remove the most recent file' },
];
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: { runCommand },
  messages,
});

messages.push(...result.response.messages);

for (const part of result.content) {
  if (part.type === 'tool-approval-request') {
    console.log(part.approvalId); // Unique ID for this approval request
    console.log(part.toolCall); // Contains toolName, input, etc.
  }
}
```

To respond, create a `tool-approval-response` and add it to your messages:

```ts
import { type ToolApprovalResponse } from 'ai';

const approvals: ToolApprovalResponse[] = [];

for (const part of result.content) {
  if (part.type === 'tool-approval-request') {
    const response: ToolApprovalResponse = {
      type: 'tool-approval-response',
      approvalId: part.approvalId,
      approved: true, // or false to deny
      reason: 'User confirmed the command', // Optional context for the model
    };
    approvals.push(response);
  }
}

// add approvals to messages
messages.push({ role: 'tool', content: approvals });
```

Then call `generateText` again with the updated messages. If approved, the tool executes. If denied, the model receives the denial and can respond accordingly.

<Note>
  When a tool execution is denied, consider adding a system instruction like
  "When a tool execution is not approved, do not retry it" to prevent the model
  from attempting the same call again.
</Note>

### Dynamic Approval

You can make approval decisions based on tool input by providing an async function:

```ts
const paymentTool = tool({
  description: 'Process a payment',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    amount: z.number(),
    recipient: z.string(),
  }),
  needsApproval: async ({ amount }) => amount > 1000,
  execute: async ({ amount, recipient }) => {
    return await processPayment(amount, recipient);
  },
});
```

In this example, only transactions over $1000 require approval. Smaller transactions execute automatically.

### Tool Execution Approval with useChat

When using `useChat`, the approval flow is handled through UI state. See [Chatbot Tool Usage](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-tool-usage#tool-execution-approval) for details on handling approvals in your UI with `addToolApprovalResponse`.

## Multi-Step Calls (using stopWhen)

With the `stopWhen` setting, you can enable multi-step calls in `generateText` and `streamText`. When `stopWhen` is set and the model generates a tool call, the AI SDK will trigger a new generation passing in the tool result until there are no further tool calls or the stopping condition is met.

<Note>
  The `stopWhen` conditions are only evaluated when the last step contains tool
  results.
</Note>

By default, when you use `generateText` or `streamText`, it triggers a single generation. This works well for many use cases where you can rely on the model's training data to generate a response. However, when you provide tools, the model now has the choice to either generate a normal text response, or generate a tool call. If the model generates a tool call, its generation is complete and that step is finished.

You may want the model to generate text after the tool has been executed, either to summarize the tool results in the context of the users query. In many cases, you may also want the model to use multiple tools in a single response. This is where multi-step calls come in.

You can think of multi-step calls in a similar way to a conversation with a human. When you ask a question, if the person does not have the requisite knowledge in their common knowledge (a model's training data), the person may need to look up information (use a tool) before they can provide you with an answer. In the same way, the model may need to call a tool to get the information it needs to answer your question where each generation (tool call or text generation) is a step.

### Example

In the following example, there are two steps:

1. **Step 1**
   1. The prompt `'What is the weather in San Francisco?'` is sent to the model.
   1. The model generates a tool call.
   1. The tool call is executed.
1. **Step 2**
   1. The tool result is sent to the model.
   1. The model generates a response considering the tool result.

```ts highlight="18-19"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { text, steps } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5), // stop after a maximum of 5 steps if tools were called
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

<Note>You can use `streamText` in a similar way.</Note>

### Steps

To access intermediate tool calls and results, you can use the `steps` property in the result object
or the `streamText` `onFinish` callback.
It contains all the text, tool calls, tool results, and more from each step.

#### Example: Extract tool results from all steps

```ts highlight="3,9-10"
import { generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { steps } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
  // ...
});

// extract all tool calls from the steps:
const allToolCalls = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolCalls);
```

### `onStepFinish` callback

When using `generateText` or `streamText`, you can provide an `onStepFinish` callback that
is triggered when a step is finished,
i.e. all text deltas, tool calls, and tool results for the step are available.
When you have multiple steps, the callback is triggered for each step.

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  onStepFinish({ text, toolCalls, toolResults, finishReason, usage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage
  },
});
```

### `prepareStep` callback

The `prepareStep` callback is called before a step is started.

It is called with the following parameters:

- `model`: The model that was passed into `generateText`.
- `stopWhen`: The stopping condition that was passed into `generateText`.
- `stepNumber`: The number of the step that is being executed.
- `steps`: The steps that have been executed so far.
- `messages`: The messages that will be sent to the model for the current step.
- `experimental_context`: The context passed via the `experimental_context` setting (experimental).

You can use it to provide different settings for a step, including modifying the input messages.

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  prepareStep: async ({ model, stepNumber, steps, messages }) => {
    if (stepNumber === 0) {
      return {
        // use a different model for this step:
        model: modelForThisParticularStep,
        // force a tool choice for this step:
        toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'tool1' },
        // limit the tools that are available for this step:
        activeTools: ['tool1'],
      };
    }

    // when nothing is returned, the default settings are used
  },
});
```

#### Message Modification for Longer Agentic Loops

In longer agentic loops, you can use the `messages` parameter to modify the input messages for each step. This is particularly useful for prompt compression:

```tsx
prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, steps, messages }) => {
  // Compress conversation history for longer loops
  if (messages.length > 20) {
    return {
      messages: messages.slice(-10),
    };
  }

  return {};
},
```

#### Provider Options for Step Configuration

You can use `providerOptions` in `prepareStep` to pass provider-specific configuration for each step. This is useful for features like Anthropic's code execution container persistence:

```tsx
import { forwardAnthropicContainerIdFromLastStep } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';

// Propagate container ID from previous step for code execution continuity
prepareStep: forwardAnthropicContainerIdFromLastStep,
```

## Response Messages

Adding the generated assistant and tool messages to your conversation history is a common task,
especially if you are using multi-step tool calls.

Both `generateText` and `streamText` have a `response.messages` property that you can use to
add the assistant and tool messages to your conversation history.
It is also available in the `onFinish` callback of `streamText`.

The `response.messages` property contains an array of `ModelMessage` objects that you can add to your conversation history:

```ts
import { generateText, ModelMessage } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [
  // ...
];

const { response } = await generateText({
  // ...
  messages,
});

// add the response messages to your conversation history:
messages.push(...response.messages); // streamText: ...((await response).messages)
```

## Dynamic Tools

AI SDK Core supports dynamic tools for scenarios where tool schemas are not known at compile time. This is useful for:

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools without schemas
- User-defined functions at runtime
- Tools loaded from external sources

### Using dynamicTool

The `dynamicTool` helper creates tools with unknown input/output types:

```ts
import { dynamicTool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const customTool = dynamicTool({
  description: 'Execute a custom function',
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  execute: async input => {
    // input is typed as 'unknown'
    // You need to validate/cast it at runtime
    const { action, parameters } = input as any;

    // Execute your dynamic logic
    return { result: `Executed ${action}` };
  },
});
```

### Type-Safe Handling

When using both static and dynamic tools, use the `dynamic` flag for type narrowing:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    // Static tool with known types
    weather: weatherTool,
    // Dynamic tool
    custom: dynamicTool({
      /* ... */
    }),
  },
  onStepFinish: ({ toolCalls, toolResults }) => {
    // Type-safe iteration
    for (const toolCall of toolCalls) {
      if (toolCall.dynamic) {
        // Dynamic tool: input is 'unknown'
        console.log('Dynamic:', toolCall.toolName, toolCall.input);
        continue;
      }

      // Static tool: full type inference
      switch (toolCall.toolName) {
        case 'weather':
          console.log(toolCall.input.location); // typed as string
          break;
      }
    }
  },
});
```

## Preliminary Tool Results

You can return an `AsyncIterable` over multiple results.
In this case, the last value from the iterable is the final tool result.

This can be used in combination with generator functions to e.g. stream status information
during the tool execution:

```ts
tool({
  description: 'Get the current weather.',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string(),
  }),
  async *execute({ location }) {
    yield {
      status: 'loading' as const,
      text: `Getting weather for ${location}`,
      weather: undefined,
    };

    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

    const temperature = 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;

    yield {
      status: 'success' as const,
      text: `The weather in ${location} is ${temperature}°F`,
      temperature,
    };
  },
});
```

## Tool Choice

You can use the `toolChoice` setting to influence when a tool is selected.
It supports the following settings:

- `auto` (default): the model can choose whether and which tools to call.
- `required`: the model must call a tool. It can choose which tool to call.
- `none`: the model must not call tools
- `{ type: 'tool', toolName: string (typed) }`: the model must call the specified tool

```ts highlight="18"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  toolChoice: 'required', // force the model to call a tool
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

## Tool Execution Options

When tools are called, they receive additional options as a second parameter.

### Tool Call ID

The ID of the tool call is forwarded to the tool execution.
You can use it e.g. when sending tool-call related information with stream data.

```ts highlight="14-20"
import {
  streamText,
  tool,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
} from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const stream = createUIMessageStream({
    execute: ({ writer }) => {
      const result = streamText({
        // ...
        messages,
        tools: {
          myTool: tool({
            // ...
            execute: async (args, { toolCallId }) => {
              // return e.g. custom status for tool call
              writer.write({
                type: 'data-tool-status',
                id: toolCallId,
                data: {
                  name: 'myTool',
                  status: 'in-progress',
                },
              });
              // ...
            },
          }),
        },
      });

      writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
    },
  });

  return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
}
```

### Messages

The messages that were sent to the language model to initiate the response that contained the tool call are forwarded to the tool execution.
You can access them in the second parameter of the `execute` function.
In multi-step calls, the messages contain the text, tool calls, and tool results from all previous steps.

```ts highlight="8-9"
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  tools: {
    myTool: tool({
      // ...
      execute: async (args, { messages }) => {
        // use the message history in e.g. calls to other language models
        return { ... };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Abort Signals

The abort signals from `generateText` and `streamText` are forwarded to the tool execution.
You can access them in the second parameter of the `execute` function and e.g. abort long-running computations or forward them to fetch calls inside tools.

```ts highlight="6,11,14"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  abortSignal: myAbortSignal, // signal that will be forwarded to tools
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ location }, { abortSignal }) => {
        return fetch(
          `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=${location}`,
          { signal: abortSignal }, // forward the abort signal to fetch
        );
      },
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

### Context (experimental)

You can pass in arbitrary context from `generateText` or `streamText` via the `experimental_context` setting.
This context is available in the `experimental_context` tool execution option.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  tools: {
    someTool: tool({
      // ...
      execute: async (input, { experimental_context: context }) => {
        const typedContext = context as { example: string }; // or use type validation library
        // ...
      },
    }),
  },
  experimental_context: { example: '123' },
});
```

## Tool Input Lifecycle Hooks

The following tool input lifecycle hooks are available:

- **`onInputStart`**: Called when the model starts generating the input (arguments) for the tool call
- **`onInputDelta`**: Called for each chunk of text as the input is streamed
- **`onInputAvailable`**: Called when the complete input is available and validated

`onInputStart` and `onInputDelta` are only called in streaming contexts (when using `streamText`). They are not called when using `generateText`.

### Example

```ts highlight="15-23"
import { streamText, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = streamText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
      onInputStart: () => {
        console.log('Tool call starting');
      },
      onInputDelta: ({ inputTextDelta }) => {
        console.log('Received input chunk:', inputTextDelta);
      },
      onInputAvailable: ({ input }) => {
        console.log('Complete input:', input);
      },
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

## Types

Modularizing your code often requires defining types to ensure type safety and reusability.
To enable this, the AI SDK provides several helper types for tools, tool calls, and tool results.

You can use them to strongly type your variables, function parameters, and return types
in parts of the code that are not directly related to `streamText` or `generateText`.

Each tool call is typed with `ToolCall<NAME extends string, ARGS>`, depending
on the tool that has been invoked.
Similarly, the tool results are typed with `ToolResult<NAME extends string, ARGS, RESULT>`.

The tools in `streamText` and `generateText` are defined as a `ToolSet`.
The type inference helpers `TypedToolCall<TOOLS extends ToolSet>`
and `TypedToolResult<TOOLS extends ToolSet>` can be used to
extract the tool call and tool result types from the tools.

```ts highlight="18-19,23-24"
import { TypedToolCall, TypedToolResult, generateText, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const myToolSet = {
  firstTool: tool({
    description: 'Greets the user',
    inputSchema: z.object({ name: z.string() }),
    execute: async ({ name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`,
  }),
  secondTool: tool({
    description: 'Tells the user their age',
    inputSchema: z.object({ age: z.number() }),
    execute: async ({ age }) => `You are ${age} years old!`,
  }),
};

type MyToolCall = TypedToolCall<typeof myToolSet>;
type MyToolResult = TypedToolResult<typeof myToolSet>;

async function generateSomething(prompt: string): Promise<{
  text: string;
  toolCalls: Array<MyToolCall>; // typed tool calls
  toolResults: Array<MyToolResult>; // typed tool results
}> {
  return generateText({
    model: __MODEL__,
    tools: myToolSet,
    prompt,
  });
}
```

## Handling Errors

The AI SDK has three tool-call related errors:

- [`NoSuchToolError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-no-such-tool-error): the model tries to call a tool that is not defined in the tools object
- [`InvalidToolInputError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-invalid-tool-input-error): the model calls a tool with inputs that do not match the tool's input schema
- [`ToolCallRepairError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-tool-call-repair-error): an error that occurred during tool call repair

When tool execution fails (errors thrown by your tool's `execute` function), the AI SDK adds them as `tool-error` content parts to enable automated LLM roundtrips in multi-step scenarios.

### `generateText`

`generateText` throws errors for tool schema validation issues and other errors, and can be handled using a `try`/`catch` block. Tool execution errors appear as `tool-error` parts in the result steps:

```ts
try {
  const result = await generateText({
    //...
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (NoSuchToolError.isInstance(error)) {
    // handle the no such tool error
  } else if (InvalidToolInputError.isInstance(error)) {
    // handle the invalid tool inputs error
  } else {
    // handle other errors
  }
}
```

Tool execution errors are available in the result steps:

```ts
const { steps } = await generateText({
  // ...
});

// check for tool errors in the steps
const toolErrors = steps.flatMap(step =>
  step.content.filter(part => part.type === 'tool-error'),
);

toolErrors.forEach(toolError => {
  console.log('Tool error:', toolError.error);
  console.log('Tool name:', toolError.toolName);
  console.log('Tool input:', toolError.input);
});
```

### `streamText`

`streamText` sends errors as part of the full stream. Tool execution errors appear as `tool-error` parts, while other errors appear as `error` parts.

When using `toUIMessageStreamResponse`, you can pass an `onError` function to extract the error message from the error part and forward it as part of the stream response:

```ts
const result = streamText({
  // ...
});

return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
  onError: error => {
    if (NoSuchToolError.isInstance(error)) {
      return 'The model tried to call a unknown tool.';
    } else if (InvalidToolInputError.isInstance(error)) {
      return 'The model called a tool with invalid inputs.';
    } else {
      return 'An unknown error occurred.';
    }
  },
});
```

## Tool Call Repair

<Note type="warning">
  The tool call repair feature is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

Language models sometimes fail to generate valid tool calls,
especially when the input schema is complex or the model is smaller.

If you use multiple steps, those failed tool calls will be sent back to the LLM
in the next step to give it an opportunity to fix it.
However, you may want to control how invalid tool calls are repaired without requiring
additional steps that pollute the message history.

You can use the `experimental_repairToolCall` function to attempt to repair the tool call
with a custom function.

You can use different strategies to repair the tool call:

- Use a model with structured outputs to generate the inputs.
- Send the messages, system prompt, and tool schema to a stronger model to generate the inputs.
- Provide more specific repair instructions based on which tool was called.

### Example: Use a model with structured outputs for repair

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject, generateText, NoSuchToolError, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model,
  tools,
  prompt,

  experimental_repairToolCall: async ({
    toolCall,
    tools,
    inputSchema,
    error,
  }) => {
    if (NoSuchToolError.isInstance(error)) {
      return null; // do not attempt to fix invalid tool names
    }

    const tool = tools[toolCall.toolName as keyof typeof tools];

    const { object: repairedArgs } = await generateObject({
      model: __MODEL__,
      schema: tool.inputSchema,
      prompt: [
        `The model tried to call the tool "${toolCall.toolName}"` +
          ` with the following inputs:`,
        JSON.stringify(toolCall.input),
        `The tool accepts the following schema:`,
        JSON.stringify(inputSchema(toolCall)),
        'Please fix the inputs.',
      ].join('\n'),
    });

    return { ...toolCall, input: JSON.stringify(repairedArgs) };
  },
});
```

### Example: Use the re-ask strategy for repair

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject, generateText, NoSuchToolError, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model,
  tools,
  prompt,

  experimental_repairToolCall: async ({
    toolCall,
    tools,
    error,
    messages,
    system,
  }) => {
    const result = await generateText({
      model,
      system,
      messages: [
        ...messages,
        {
          role: 'assistant',
          content: [
            {
              type: 'tool-call',
              toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
              toolName: toolCall.toolName,
              input: toolCall.input,
            },
          ],
        },
        {
          role: 'tool' as const,
          content: [
            {
              type: 'tool-result',
              toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
              toolName: toolCall.toolName,
              output: error.message,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      tools,
    });

    const newToolCall = result.toolCalls.find(
      newToolCall => newToolCall.toolName === toolCall.toolName,
    );

    return newToolCall != null
      ? {
          type: 'tool-call' as const,
          toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
          toolName: toolCall.toolName,
          input: JSON.stringify(newToolCall.input),
        }
      : null;
  },
});
```

## Active Tools

Language models can only handle a limited number of tools at a time, depending on the model.
To allow for static typing using a large number of tools and limiting the available tools to the model at the same time,
the AI SDK provides the `activeTools` property.

It is an array of tool names that are currently active.
By default, the value is `undefined` and all tools are active.

```ts highlight="7"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: myToolSet,
  activeTools: ['firstTool'],
});
```

## Multi-modal Tool Results

<Note type="warning">
  Multi-modal tool results are experimental and only supported by Anthropic and
  OpenAI.
</Note>

In order to send multi-modal tool results, e.g. screenshots, back to the model,
they need to be converted into a specific format.

AI SDK Core tools have an optional `toModelOutput` function
that converts the tool result into a content part.

Here is an example for converting a screenshot into a content part:

```ts highlight="22-27"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    computer: anthropic.tools.computer_20241022({
      // ...
      async execute({ action, coordinate, text }) {
        switch (action) {
          case 'screenshot': {
            return {
              type: 'image',
              data: fs
                .readFileSync('./data/screenshot-editor.png')
                .toString('base64'),
            };
          }
          default: {
            return `executed ${action}`;
          }
        }
      },

      // map to tool result content for LLM consumption:
      toModelOutput({ output }) {
        return {
          type: 'content',
          value:
            typeof output === 'string'
              ? [{ type: 'text', text: output }]
              : [{ type: 'media', data: output.data, mediaType: 'image/png' }],
        };
      },
    }),
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Extracting Tools

Once you start having many tools, you might want to extract them into separate files.
The `tool` helper function is crucial for this, because it ensures correct type inference.

Here is an example of an extracted tool:

```ts filename="tools/weather-tool.ts" highlight="1,4-5"
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// the `tool` helper function ensures correct type inference:
export const weatherTool = tool({
  description: 'Get the weather in a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }) => ({
    location,
    temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
  }),
});
```

## MCP Tools

The AI SDK supports connecting to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to access their tools.
MCP enables your AI applications to discover and use tools across various services through a standardized interface.

For detailed information about MCP tools, including initialization, transport options, and usage patterns, see the [MCP Tools documentation](/docs/ai-sdk-core/mcp-tools).

### AI SDK Tools vs MCP Tools

In most cases, you should define your own AI SDK tools for production applications. They provide full control, type safety, and optimal performance. MCP tools are best suited for rapid development iteration and scenarios where users bring their own tools.

| Aspect                 | AI SDK Tools                                              | MCP Tools                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type Safety**        | Full static typing end-to-end                             | Dynamic discovery at runtime                          |
| **Execution**          | Same process as your request (low latency)                | Separate server (network overhead)                    |
| **Prompt Control**     | Full control over descriptions and schemas                | Controlled by MCP server owner                        |
| **Schema Control**     | You define and optimize for your model                    | Controlled by MCP server owner                        |
| **Version Management** | Full visibility over updates                              | Can update independently (version skew risk)          |
| **Authentication**     | Same process, no additional auth required                 | Separate server introduces additional auth complexity |
| **Best For**           | Production applications requiring control and performance | Development iteration, user-provided tools            |

# Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, your use case will likely call for generating structured data.
For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data.

Many language models are capable of generating structured data, often defined as using "JSON modes" or "tools".
However, you need to manually provide schemas and then validate the generated data as LLMs can produce incorrect or incomplete structured data.

The AI SDK standardises structured object generation across model providers
using the `output` property on [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text)
and [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text).
You can use [Zod schemas](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/zod-schema), [Valibot](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/valibot-schema), or [JSON schemas](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) to specify the shape of the data that you want,
and the AI model will generate data that conforms to that structure.

<Note>
  Structured output generation is part of the `generateText` and `streamText`
  flow. This means you can combine it with tool calling in the same request.
</Note>

## Generating Structured Outputs

Use `generateText` with `Output.object()` to generate structured data from a prompt.
The schema is also used to validate the generated data, ensuring type safety and correctness.

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { output } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      recipe: z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        ingredients: z.array(
          z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() }),
        ),
        steps: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

<Note>
  Structured output generation counts as a step in the AI SDK's multi-turn
  execution model (where each model call or tool execution is one step). When
  combining with tools, account for this in your `stopWhen` configuration.
</Note>

### Accessing response headers & body

Sometimes you need access to the full response from the model provider,
e.g. to access some provider-specific headers or body content.

You can access the raw response headers and body using the `response` property:

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.object({ schema }),
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.headers, null, 2));
console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.body, null, 2));
```

## Stream Structured Outputs

Given the added complexity of returning structured data, model response time can be unacceptable for your interactive use case.
With `streamText` and `output`, you can stream the model's structured response as it is generated.

```ts
import { streamText, Output } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { partialOutputStream } = streamText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      recipe: z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        ingredients: z.array(
          z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() }),
        ),
        steps: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});

// use partialOutputStream as an async iterable
for await (const partialObject of partialOutputStream) {
  console.log(partialObject);
}
```

You can consume the structured output on the client with the [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) hook.

### Error Handling in Streams

`streamText` starts streaming immediately. When errors occur during streaming, they become part of the stream rather than thrown exceptions (to prevent stream crashes).

To handle errors, provide an `onError` callback:

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { streamText, Output } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  // ...
  output: Output.object({ schema }),
  onError({ error }) {
    console.error(error); // log to your error tracking service
  },
});
```

For non-streaming error handling with `generateText`, see the [Error Handling](#error-handling) section below.

## Output Types

The AI SDK supports multiple ways of specifying the expected structure of generated data via the `Output` object. You can select from various strategies for structured/text generation and validation.

### `Output.text()`

Use `Output.text()` to generate plain text from a model. This option doesn't enforce any schema on the result: you simply receive the model's text as a string. This is the default behavior when no `output` is specified.

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';

const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.text(),
  prompt: 'Tell me a joke.',
});
// output will be a string (the joke)
```

### `Output.object()`

Use `Output.object({ schema })` to generate a structured object based on a schema (for example, a Zod schema). The output is type-validated to ensure the returned result matches the schema.

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      age: z.number().nullable(),
      labels: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate information for a test user.',
});
// output will be an object matching the schema above
```

<Note>
  Partial outputs streamed via `streamText` cannot be validated against your
  provided schema, as incomplete data may not yet conform to the expected
  structure.
</Note>

### `Output.array()`

Use `Output.array({ element })` to specify that you expect an array of typed objects from the model, where each element should conform to a schema (defined in the `element` property).

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.array({
    element: z.object({
      location: z.string(),
      temperature: z.number(),
      condition: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'List the weather for San Francisco and Paris.',
});
// output will be an array of objects like:
// [
//   { location: 'San Francisco', temperature: 70, condition: 'Sunny' },
//   { location: 'Paris', temperature: 65, condition: 'Cloudy' },
// ]
```

When streaming arrays with `streamText`, you can use `elementStream` to receive each completed element as it is generated:

```ts
import { streamText, Output } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { elementStream } = streamText({
  // ...
  output: Output.array({
    element: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      class: z.string(),
      description: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate 3 hero descriptions for a fantasy role playing game.',
});

for await (const hero of elementStream) {
  console.log(hero); // Each hero is complete and validated
}
```

<Note>
  Each element emitted by `elementStream` is complete and validated against your
  element schema. This differs from `partialOutputStream`, which streams the
  entire partial array including incomplete elements.
</Note>

### `Output.choice()`

Use `Output.choice({ options })` when you expect the model to choose from a specific set of string options, such as for classification or fixed-enum answers.

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';

const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.choice({
    options: ['sunny', 'rainy', 'snowy'],
  }),
  prompt: 'Is the weather sunny, rainy, or snowy today?',
});
// output will be one of: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'snowy'
```

You can provide any set of string options, and the output will always be a single string value that matches one of the specified options. The AI SDK validates that the result matches one of your options, and will throw if the model returns something invalid.

This is especially useful for making classification-style generations or forcing valid values for API compatibility.

### `Output.json()`

Use `Output.json()` when you want to generate and parse unstructured JSON values from the model, without enforcing a specific schema. This is useful if you want to capture arbitrary objects, flexible structures, or when you want to rely on the model's natural output rather than rigid validation.

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';

const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.json(),
  prompt:
    'For each city, return the current temperature and weather condition as a JSON object.',
});

// output could be any valid JSON, for example:
// {
//   "San Francisco": { "temperature": 70, "condition": "Sunny" },
//   "Paris": { "temperature": 65, "condition": "Cloudy" }
// }
```

With `Output.json`, the AI SDK only checks that the response is valid JSON; it doesn't validate the structure or types of the values. If you need schema validation, use the `.object` or `.array` outputs instead.

For more advanced validation or different structures, see [the Output API reference](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/output).

## Generating Structured Outputs with Tools

One of the key advantages of using structured output with `generateText` and `streamText` is the ability to combine it with tool calling.

```ts
import { generateText, Output, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { output } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather for a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => {
        // fetch weather data
        return { temperature: 72, condition: 'sunny' };
      },
    }),
  },
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      summary: z.string(),
      recommendation: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
  prompt: 'What should I wear in San Francisco today?',
});
```

<Note>
  When using tools with structured output, remember that generating the
  structured output counts as a step. Configure `stopWhen` to allow enough steps
  for both tool execution and output generation.
</Note>

## Property Descriptions

You can add `.describe("...")` to individual schema properties to give the model hints about what each property is for. This helps improve the quality and accuracy of generated structured data:

```ts highlight="5,9"
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { output } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string().describe('The name of the recipe'),
      ingredients: z
        .array(
          z.object({
            name: z.string(),
            amount: z
              .string()
              .describe('The amount of the ingredient (grams or ml)'),
          }),
        )
        .describe('List of ingredients with amounts'),
      steps: z.array(z.string()).describe('Step-by-step cooking instructions'),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

Property descriptions are particularly useful for:

- Clarifying ambiguous property names
- Specifying expected formats or conventions
- Providing context for complex nested structures

## Output Name and Description

You can optionally specify a `name` and `description` for the output. These are used by some providers for additional LLM guidance, e.g. via tool or schema name.

```ts highlight="6-7"
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { output } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: Output.object({
    name: 'Recipe',
    description: 'A recipe for a dish.',
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

This works with all output types that support structured generation:

- `Output.object({ name, description, schema })`
- `Output.array({ name, description, element })`
- `Output.choice({ name, description, options })`
- `Output.json({ name, description })`

## Accessing Reasoning

You can access the reasoning used by the language model to generate the object via the `reasoning` property on the result. This property contains a string with the model's thought process, if available.

```ts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__, // must be a reasoning model
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      recipe: z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        ingredients: z.array(
          z.object({
            name: z.string(),
            amount: z.string(),
          }),
        ),
        steps: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});

console.log(result.reasoningText);
```

## Error Handling

When `generateText` with structured output cannot generate a valid object, it throws a [`AI_NoObjectGeneratedError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-no-object-generated-error).

This error occurs when the AI provider fails to generate a parsable object that conforms to the schema.
It can arise due to the following reasons:

- The model failed to generate a response.
- The model generated a response that could not be parsed.
- The model generated a response that could not be validated against the schema.

The error preserves the following information to help you log the issue:

- `text`: The text that was generated by the model. This can be the raw text or the tool call text, depending on the object generation mode.
- `response`: Metadata about the language model response, including response id, timestamp, and model.
- `usage`: Request token usage.
- `cause`: The cause of the error (e.g. a JSON parsing error). You can use this for more detailed error handling.

```ts
import { generateText, Output, NoObjectGeneratedError } from 'ai';

try {
  await generateText({
    model,
    output: Output.object({ schema }),
    prompt,
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (NoObjectGeneratedError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.log('NoObjectGeneratedError');
    console.log('Cause:', error.cause);
    console.log('Text:', error.text);
    console.log('Response:', error.response);
    console.log('Usage:', error.usage);
  }
}
```

## generateObject and streamObject (Legacy)

<Note type="warning">
  `generateObject` and `streamObject` are deprecated. Use `generateText` and
  `streamText` with the `output` property instead. The legacy functions will be
  removed in a future major version.
</Note>

The `generateObject` and `streamObject` functions are the legacy way to generate structured data. They work similarly to `generateText` and `streamText` with `Output.object()`, but as standalone functions.

### generateObject

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: __MODEL__,
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

### streamObject

```ts
import { streamObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { partialObjectStream } = streamObject({
  model: __MODEL__,
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});

for await (const partialObject of partialObjectStream) {
  console.log(partialObject);
}
```

### Schema Name and Description (Legacy)

You can optionally specify a name and description for the schema. These are used by some providers for additional LLM guidance, e.g. via tool or schema name.

```ts highlight="4-5"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: __MODEL__,
  schemaName: 'Recipe',
  schemaDescription: 'A recipe for a dish.',
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
    steps: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

### Output Strategy (Legacy)

The legacy functions support different output strategies via the `output` parameter:

#### Array

Generate an array of objects. The schema specifies the shape of an array element.

```ts highlight="7"
import { streamObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const { elementStream } = streamObject({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: 'array',
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    class: z
      .string()
      .describe('Character class, e.g. warrior, mage, or thief.'),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate 3 hero descriptions for a fantasy role playing game.',
});

for await (const hero of elementStream) {
  console.log(hero);
}
```

#### Enum

Generate a specific enum value for classification tasks.

```ts highlight="5-6"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: 'enum',
  enum: ['action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'horror', 'sci-fi'],
  prompt:
    'Classify the genre of this movie plot: ' +
    '"A group of astronauts travel through a wormhole in search of a ' +
    'new habitable planet for humanity."',
});
```

#### No Schema

Generate unstructured JSON without a schema.

```ts highlight="6"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: 'no-schema',
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

### Repairing Invalid JSON (Legacy)

<Note type="warning">
  The `repairText` function is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

Sometimes the model will generate invalid or malformed JSON.
You can use the `repairText` function to attempt to repair the JSON.

```ts highlight="7-10"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model,
  schema,
  prompt,
  experimental_repairText: async ({ text, error }) => {
    // example: add a closing brace to the text
    return text + '}';
  },
});
```

## More Examples
